## What

Source for the BC child care vacancy bot [placeholder for bot link]() built by [Victor Yuan](https://victoryuan.com). The repo contains a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) that executes R code on every day to:

1. Pull out data from [BC Child Care dataset](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/child-care-map-data/resource/9a9f14e1-03ea-4a11-936a-6e77b15eeb39)
2. Check daily for any new vacancies
3. Generate a summary of new vacancies
4. report vacancies to Mastodon / Twitter

This bot is built following [Matt Dray's](https://www.matt-dray.com) [@londonmapbot](https://www.botsin.space/londonmapbot).

## How to follow

For Mastodon, create an account on a Instance of your choosing (not botsin.space, which is only for bot accounts). Then follow [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/@bcchildcarebot@botsin.space-white?style=flat&labelColor=purple&logo=Mastodon&logoColor=white)](https://botsin.space/@bcchildcarebot) and turn on notifications.
