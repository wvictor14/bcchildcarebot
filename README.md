# bcchildcarevacancybot

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

## What

Source for the BC child care vacancy bot [placeholder for bot link]() built by [Victor Yuan](https://victoryuan.com). The repo contains a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) that executes R code on every day to:

1. Pull out data from BC Child care vacancies dataset
2. Compare to yesterday's dataset to identify any new vacancies
3. Generate a summary of new vacancies
4. report vacancies to Twitter

This bot is built following [Matt Dray's](https://www.matt-dray.com) [@londonmapbot](https://www.twitter.com/londonmapbot).
